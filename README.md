# 👋 Hi, I'm Daria

💡 **Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Data Engineer**

I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with an engineering background in rocket propulsion.  
I like solving messy real world problems with clean logic and data. I work across the stack from collecting and cleaning data to building models and explaining results in a simple way.

I finished my Master's in Data Science at CUNY School of Professional Studies in May 2025, currently working in a healthcare startup.  
I'm based in Tampa, Florida and open to remote, hybrid, or on site work.  
I'm looking for new opportunities and always happy to connect.



## What I Do

🧠 **As a Data Scientist**, I take complex data and turn it into clear answers. I enjoy exploring patterns, testing ideas, learning everything about the field, and building models that explain how things work and what might happen next.

🤖 **As a Machine Learning Engineer**, I build and train models that solve real problems. I like improving how systems learn from data, how it's predicting, recommending, or automating something that used to take hours.

🛠️ **As a Data Engineer**, I make sure the data is ready for everything else. I design clean and reliable pipelines, automate messy steps, keep things organized so data scientists and teams can focus on the problem-solving.

📈 **Together**, I help teams make data part of everyday decisions. Sometimes that means creating a model, sometimes cleaning a million rows, sometimes building a whole workflow from raw files to a dashboard. I just like making it work and making it make sense.
